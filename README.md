# No longer updated!
This plugin is not maintained anymore. I am no longer working on bukkit and spigot plugins.
If you need it updated, contact me directly, or update it yourself. 
The current code in this state should continue working even with Minecraft 1.13 and up, until spigot breaks backwards compatibility again.

## Beta 1.7.3 world generator
This plugin generates beta 1.7.3 terrain.

[Bukkit dev page](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/b173gen/)

### Usage

Use it like any other generator To use it without a multi-world plugin, append this to your bukkit.yml:
```yaml
worlds:
     world_name:
          generator: 173generator
```
To use it with a multi-world plugin, follow the instructions for that plugin.
